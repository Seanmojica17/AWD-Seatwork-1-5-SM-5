## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
This project is a bus reservation system designed to manage the daily operations of 3 buses, allowing passengers to check seat availability and reserve up to 5 seats per bus. The purpose of the project is to provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies the reservation process, making it easier for passengers to plan their trips and secure seats in advance. The system includes key components such as bus management, seat availability checks, a reservation system, and an intuitive user interface. The technology used includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the layout of the system, creating the framework for the user interface. CSS is used to style the page, ensuring the design is responsive and visually appealing. JavaScript handles the dynamic functionality of the system, allowing for real-time seat availability checks and reservations, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience for the users.
